## Examples

There are some [included examples](Examples/Noise/), you can also find them in your Clickteam Fusion 2.5/Examples/Noise/ folder after you installed Noise.
Noise sandbox.mfa is great for experimenting with different settings.


## Wiki

I recently finaly created Noise Object [wiki on github](https://github.com/kapi1525/NoiseExtension/wiki). There you can find more info about what each ACEs and properties do and some nice screenshots.


## Help file

I wanted to automaticaly convert github wiki to help file, but in the end it was too complicated and buggy so i scrapped it. Currently help button in Noise object about properties just redirects you to the github wiki.


## Installing

You can find Noise object in Clickteam Fusion's extension manager, or install it manualy by following install instructions below.

To install Noise Object, just download [latest release](https://github.com/kapi1525/NoiseExtension/releases/latest), unzip it and copy all files to correct directories in your Fusion install (Often: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Clickteam Fusion 2.5\"). Also this extension uses dark edif update checker, this means you will receive notifications about updates in Fusion. Updating extension is the same as installing it, just override old files.
